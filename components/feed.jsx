But if you talked to a fast food worker, you‚Äôd know better. TikTok creator Maya (@aa.mayaaaaaaaa) regularly posts content about the quirks of working at Taco Bell to more than 6,000 followers. Last month, she uploaded a viral video about working the drive-thru that had viewers rushing to the comments to commiserate. The video has almost 3 million views and more than 371,000 likes. ‚ÄúHi, what can I get for you?‚Äù Maya says into a drive-thru headset in the video skit. The unseen ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù orders a No. 10. Maya asks what they‚Äôd like for the drink that comes with the meal. ‚ÄúUm, I don‚Äôt want the drink. I just want the burrito,‚Äù the customer replies. ‚ÄúSo, you don‚Äôt want the combo then?‚Äù Maya asks. ‚ÄúNo, I want the combo, just the burrito by itself,‚Äù the customer says. The video ends with Maya beset by comic frustration. Viewers really felt Maya‚Äôs pain. One commenter wrote, ‚Äúor they‚Äôll say not the combo then end up ordering a combo separately.‚Äù Another viewer replied, ‚ÄúNah if they do that they getting charged for that all separately (I do this all the time).‚Äù Someone else replied, ‚Äúreally depends on the person for me. i call it stupids fee.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs an ex [Taco Bell] employee this is so real man,‚Äù another person wrote. ‚ÄúI work at McDonald‚Äôs and this drives me Insane,‚Äù a comment read. ‚ÄúThis was me today at work at [Chick-fil-A]. I guess everybody doesn‚Äôt have common sense,‚Äù one viewer commented. Maya replied, ‚ÄúWorking in fast food makes you realize how stupid people can be.‚Äù Several commenters posted their own versions of frustrating customer service interactions: ‚Äú‚Äòdo you want me to make that a combo?‚Äô ‚Äòno i just want the sub, chips, and drink.‚Äô‚Äù Another variation: ‚Äú‚ÄòAnything else for you today?‚Äô ‚ÄòYes‚Äô ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ silence ‚Äòokay what can I get for you‚Äô ‚Äònothing that‚Äôs everything.‚Äô‚Äù @aa.mayaaaaaaaa #fyp #fastfood #tacobell #relatable ‚ô¨ original sound - Maya ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ask if they want the combo and they‚Äôll be like ‚Äòno just the sandwich‚Äô they get to the window and be like e ‚Äòwhere my drink‚Äô huhhhhh,‚Äù a viewer chimed in. One commenter wrote, ‚Äúthe worst is when fast food employees visit other fast food places, and do this.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe way people used to test my sanity. Working fast food is not for the weak,‚Äù someone else commented. ‚ÄúAt my old job, this lady asked for a cheese pizza with pepperoni on it so I had said ‚Äòa pepperoni pizza ma‚Äôam?‚Äô She said no a cheese pizza with pep,‚Äù one viewer wrote. Some commenters came with encouragement: ‚Äúbe strong queen we have all been there with those type of people.‚Äù The Daily Dot reached out to Maya via TikTok and Taco Bell via email. TikTok has become a forum for fast food workers to share their most vexing customer interactions. One worker said a customer parked in the drive-thru for 20 minutes to eat her breakfast. And a McDonald‚Äôs drive-thru worker complained about customers who ask for sauce at the window instead of during their order.

What interests me is the Karachi‚Äôs coastline. The whole of Pakistan has a 1050-long coast line of which 250 km falls in the Sindh province. Out of this, Karachi has a 70km long coastline. For all intents and purposes Karachi is a city by the sea but it is very hard to discover this glaring fact by ordinary visitors as unlike other cities by the sea, Karachi has none of the distinctive signage that you see in other coastal towns. There are no distinctive seaside food outlets with imaginative names such as I found in other cities like The Catcher‚Äôs Cove, Oceanic Delights, Seaside Feast, The Seafood Shack, SaltwaterBistro, The Clamshell, etc. It is not that there is any dearth of space for putting up these signs or opening outlets that provide quality sea food. For as long as I can remember the road from downtown Karachi and its suburbs to seaside spots like Sands Pit and Hawkesbay is a long and winding one but it has failed to attract any high quality sea food places and the only hospitality the shopkeepers offer are in the form of crates of cold drinks which can be obtained after a deposit. Even in the city of Karachi at prominent places and especially outside five-star hotels there are hardly any bill boards inviting our visitors to go either sailing from the nearby port of Keamari or to spend a day at the beach. With the advent of social media there is some activity online but not just enough to place Karachi as a seaside fun town with top-notch seafood restaurants and seaside entertainment in the same league as Singapore, Hong Kong or other cities by the sea. In Hong Kong, for example, there is the Jumbo restaurant. This is on a ship in the sea and you have to have prior reservations which entitle you to a boat ride that takes you to this attractive ship that serves mouthwatering delicacies at premium prices. In a clever move the management of this famous restaurant has also arranged for your photoshoot while you await your dinner. Patrons can get dressed up like Chinese emperors from the past and get their pictures taken. The outfits are provided by the management. For a price of course. Another question that comes to my mind is why are we so shy to promote our city? A popular sign in many seaside cities is ‚ÄúWelcome to Paradise‚Äù. Yes I know we have our shortcomings and maybe not eligible for such a caption but why can‚Äôt we improve and justify such slogans for our beloved city of Karachi. As a start we can start providing basic facilities on the beach. In all seaside facilities there are stands from where you can hire necessary stuff like towels, caps, etc., and buy lotions, creams and other necessary items. What is stopping concerned authorities from creating fancy stands at the beach and renting them out to use the money earned for more development at our beaches. Now that the sea front at Seaview beach in Clifton has not only been extended but improved this could be an ideal place for providing these stands with seaside utilities. What surprises me again is the absence of catchy names and attractive eateries at this newly developed Seaview extension, which has the same old mundane snack joints, pizza outlets and rather rundown tea and cold drink outlets. The few new high class restaurants also have routine names that have no association with their location. Buffet restaurants, for example, are a dime a dozen in this city but some place located in the middle of the prime sea front property can come up with a more attractive name that is related to its seaside location. I have observed that certain signs have sprung up in the city with such captions as ‚ÄúKarachi. City of Cricket‚Äù, ‚ÄúKarachi and Houston twin cities‚Äù, etc. No signs that I have come across indicate our presence by the sea. Maybe it is time to reconsider and launch an entirely new campaign targeting what is most important and making it the central theme: Karachi by the sea.
